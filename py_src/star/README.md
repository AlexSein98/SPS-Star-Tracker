# STAR README

The Star and Transient Astronomical Renderer (STAR) is a Python-based CPU renderer that creates star-catalog-informed night sky images. Stars are sampled using a Gaussian or Laplacian point spread function, as are planets in most images. However, if a planet's radius is two times higher (or more) than the camera's diffraction limit, it is directly rendered via a simple raytracing algorithm.
